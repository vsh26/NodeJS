# API

a) An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software components to communicate and interact with each other. It defines how requests and responses should be structured.

b) An endpoint is a specific URL (Uniform Resource Locator) that represents a particular function or service provided by an API. It's the specific location where clients can make requests to access certain data or perform actions.

c) Example of an endpoint in a social media app: `instagram.com/{username}` to retrieve user profile on instagram.
